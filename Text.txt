Subject: Request for Rate Limit Increase – GCP Document AI

Dear GCP Support Team,

I hope you are doing well.

We are currently utilizing Google Cloud Document AI and would like to request an increase in our API rate limit. Our current rate limit is 1,800 requests per minute (RPM), but as we scale our user base, we anticipate a higher API demand.

Justification for Rate Limit Increase

Current Scenario:

User Base: 500 users

Current Rate Limit: 1,800 RPM

Estimated Active Users at Peak: ~100 (assuming 20% concurrent usage)

Requests per User: ~2 RPM

Total Expected Requests at Peak: 100 × 2 = 200 RPM

Utilization: The current 1,800 RPM is sufficient but underutilized.


Planned Expansion:

Target User Base: 10,000 users

Estimated Active Users at Peak: 2,000 (20% of 10,000)

Requests per User: 2 RPM

Total Estimated Requests at Peak: 2,000 × 2 = 4,000 RPM


To ensure smooth operations, we propose a buffer for peak load handling, which leads to the requested increase to 5,000 RPM.

Why is 5,000 RPM Ideal?

It covers peak load conditions (up to 2,500 concurrent active users at 2 RPM).

It accounts for growth and unforeseen surges in activity.

It prevents rate limiting issues, ensuring a seamless user experience.


We believe this increase aligns with our scaling plans and will optimize document processing efficiency without over-allocating resources.

Could you please guide us through the process to increase the limit, including any additional steps or approvals required? Please let us know if further details or justifications are needed.

Looking forward to your response.
