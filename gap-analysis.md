# Gap Analysis: Main Lane vs. Explore Lane Usecase Onboarding

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Main Lane (Production) | Explore Lane (Prototype) | Gap |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----|
| Usecase Setup/Onboarding | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | No gap |
| Model Onboarding | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported | No gap |
| Prompt Studio | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Supported | **Gap: Explore lane lacks prompt engineering capabilities** |
| Collection Setup (Vector DB) | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Mentioned | **Gap: Explore lane appears to lack vector database integration** |
| Chat Screen for Testing | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Supported | **Gap: Explore lane lacks testing interface** |
| Usage Metrics | ❓ Not Mentioned | ✅ Supported | **Reverse Gap: Main lane may lack usage analytics** |
| Usecase Lifespan | ❓ Presumed Permanent | ✅ Short-lived (90 days) | **Difference: Explore lane usecases are temporary** |

## Key Gaps in Explore Lane

1. **No Prompt Studio**: Explore lane users cannot fine-tune or experiment with prompts like they can in the main lane.

2. **Missing Collection Setup**: Vector database integration appears to be absent in the explore lane, limiting advanced retrieval capabilities.

3. **No Testing Interface**: The absence of a chat screen makes it difficult to test and validate usecases in the explore lane.

## Unique Features in Explore Lane

1. **Usage Metrics**: Explore lane provides usage analytics that may not be available in the main lane.

2. **Temporary Usecases**: The 90-day lifespan of explore lane usecases indicates it's designed for experimentation rather than production deployment.

## Impact Analysis

- **Development Workflow**: The explore lane appears designed for quick prototyping without the complete suite of tools, suggesting a "fail fast" approach.

- **User Experience**: Explore lane users would need to migrate to the main lane to access critical features like prompt engineering and testing.

- **Data Permanence**: The 90-day lifespan in the explore lane indicates data and configurations may be automatically deleted, requiring proper planning.

## Recommended Bridging Strategy

1. **Testing Workaround**: Implement an alternative testing mechanism for explore lane usecases.

2. **Migration Path**: Develop a clear process for transitioning from explore to main lane when prototypes prove successful.

3. **Feature Parity Consideration**: Evaluate whether prompt studio and vector DB capabilities should be added to the explore lane in limited form.

4. **Documentation**: Ensure users understand the limitations and intended purpose of each lane to set proper expectations.
