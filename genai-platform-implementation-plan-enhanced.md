# GenAI Platform Implementation Plan
## Use Case & API Lifecycle Management

[Document Version: 1.0 | Date: March 6, 2025]

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for our GenAI platform's lifecycle management capabilities. The platform will enable the creation, management, and monitoring of AI use cases and APIs across different environments (development, testing, and production) for various user personas including data scientists, developers, platform managers, and administrators.

We present two architectural approaches in this document:
1. **Single Codebase with Environment Context** - Our primary approach that maintains one codebase with environment-aware components
2. **Core Library with Environment-Specific Applications** - An alternative approach that balances code sharing with environment isolation

Both approaches support the complete lifecycle of RAG-based applications and model API endpoints, with comprehensive governance from creation to retirement.

## Architecture Approaches

### Primary Approach: Single Codebase with Environment Context

Our primary architecture approach employs a single, unified codebase that adapts to different environments through a robust Environment Context Provider. This approach ensures consistency across environments while maintaining appropriate governance boundaries.

#### Architecture Diagram

*[In a professional document, this would be a high-quality AWS-style architecture diagram showing the environment context provider at the center, with distinct paths for explore, dev, UAT and production environments, using professional icons, color coding, and clean layout with directional arrows showing data flow between components.]*

**Key Components:**

1. **Environment Context Provider**: Central component that maintains awareness of the current environment and adjusts the UI, permissions, and available actions accordingly
2. **Authentication & Role-Based Access Control**: Manages user identity and permissions based on roles and environment context
3. **Environment-Aware UI Components**: Adapts UI elements based on environment context and user role
4. **Shared Core Components**: Common UI elements and functionality that work across environments
5. **Environment-Specific API Services**: Dedicated API endpoints for each environment (Explore, Dev, UAT, Prod)
6. **Infrastructure Integration**: Connections to underlying services including vector databases, LLM services, and monitoring systems

#### Advantages:
- **Consistent Experience**: Users experience the same interface across environments
- **Reduced Development Effort**: Core functionality implemented once
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Single codebase to patch, update, and secure
- **Streamlined Promotion**: Use cases can graduate through environments with minimal friction

#### Disadvantages:
- **Complex Context Management**: Requires careful design to handle multiple environments
- **Feature Isolation Challenges**: More difficult to maintain strict separation between experimental and production features
- **Potential for Production Impact**: Changes for exploration could inadvertently affect production systems

### Alternative Approach: Core Library with Environment-Specific Applications

As an alternative, we present a hybrid architecture that balances code sharing with environment isolation through separate applications built on a common foundation.

#### Architecture Diagram

*[In a professional document, this would be a high-quality AWS-style architecture diagram showing a layered approach with a shared core library at the bottom, two separate application stacks (Explore and Main) built on top of it, and clear boundaries between environments. The diagram would use professional icons, distinct color schemes for each application, and directional flow indicators.]*

**Key Components:**

1. **Shared Core Library**:
   - Common data models and schemas
   - Shared business logic
   - Reusable UI components
   - API foundation classes
   - Authentication foundations

2. **Exploration Application**:
   - Experimental features
   - Data scientist-focused interface
   - Minimal governance controls
   - Rapid iteration capabilities
   - High customization options

3. **Main Application** (for Dev/UAT/Prod):
   - Production-grade features
   - Enterprise governance
   - Multi-environment context handling
   - Monitoring and compliance features
   - Deployment promotion workflows

#### Advantages:
- **Cleaner Separation**: Stronger isolation between exploration and production code
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Each application optimized for its target users
- **Independent Release Cycles**: Exploration can iterate rapidly without synchronizing with production
- **Reduced Complexity**: Each application is simpler than a combined solution
- **Better Security**: Lower risk of experimental features affecting production

#### Disadvantages:
- **More Code to Maintain**: Multiple applications instead of one
- **Feature Graduation Overhead**: Additional work to implement production versions of successful experiments
- **Potential Divergence**: Core library usage might drift between applications
- **Integration Challenges**: More complex testing across the entire platform ecosystem

#### Core Library Components Diagram

*[In a professional document, this would be a detailed component diagram showing the shared core library architecture with distinct layers, modules, and interfaces that both applications would consume. The diagram would use professional component notation, interface indicators, and dependency arrows.]*

## User Personas & Journey Mapping

We've identified four core user personas that will interact with the platform:

### Data Scientist
**Primary Goals**: Experiment with models, create prototypes, analyze performance
**Key Capabilities**: Create use cases, test models, analyze performance metrics
**Environment Access**: Full access to Explore, limited access to Dev, read-only for UAT/Prod

### Developer
**Primary Goals**: Implement and integrate AI services, optimize performance
**Key Capabilities**: Configure APIs, implement integration code, test systems
**Environment Access**: Full access to Explore/Dev, support access to UAT, limited access to Prod

### Platform Manager
**Primary Goals**: Oversee platform usage, approve promotions, manage resources
**Key Capabilities**: Monitor usage, approve environment transitions, manage quotas
**Environment Access**: Administrative access to all environments

### Super Admin
**Primary Goals**: Manage platform configuration, users, and security
**Key Capabilities**: Configure environments, manage users/teams, set global policies
**Environment Access**: Full administrative access to all environments and settings

### User Journey Diagram

*[In a professional document, this would be a visually appealing journey map diagram showing how each persona interacts with different environments, with clear swim lanes for each persona, touchpoints at each environment, and arrows indicating progression through the system. The diagram would use professional icons, persona avatars, and color-coding to distinguish different user types.]*

## Use Case Lifecycle Management

### Lifecycle States

Use cases in the platform follow a defined lifecycle with the following states:

*[In a professional document, this would be a professional state diagram with clean boxes representing states, directional arrows showing transitions, and clear labels explaining transition conditions. The diagram would use professional coloring (green for active, yellow for paused, blue for archived, red for deleted) and include descriptive tooltips or annotations.]*

1. **Creation**: Initial development and configuration phase
2. **Active**: Fully operational state in a specific environment
3. **Paused**: Temporarily suspended state (no API access but configuration preserved)
4. **Archived**: Cold storage state with read-only access and minimal resource usage
5. **Deleted**: Permanently removed state (data purged according to retention policies)

### Lifecycle Transition Rules

The platform will implement automated rules to govern state transitions:

*[In a professional document, this would be a decision flow diagram showing various conditions that trigger transitions between states, with clear decision diamonds, condition checks, and resulting actions. The diagram would use professional notation for decision trees, condition evaluations, and action outcomes.]*

- **Auto-Pause**: Triggered after 14 days of inactivity
- **Auto-Archive**: Applied to use cases that remain paused for 30+ days
- **Auto-Delete**: Option for archived use cases after 90+ days (with approval)
- **Manual Controls**: Override options for platform managers and admins

### Environment Promotion Workflow

*[In a professional document, this would be a workflow diagram showing the progression of a use case from Explore through Dev, UAT, and Production, with approval gates, validation checks, and transition processes. The diagram would use professional workflow notation, approval gates, and status indicators.]*

Use cases follow a structured promotion path across environments:

1. **Explore → Dev**: Initial promotion requiring basic validation
2. **Dev → UAT**: Promotion requiring thorough testing and approval
3. **UAT → Prod**: Final promotion requiring business approval and compliance validation

Each promotion includes configuration freezing, resource allocation validation, and appropriate approvals based on policy.

#### Promotion Implementation in Architecture Alternatives

**Single Codebase Approach**:
- Promotions primarily involve changing status flags and environment context
- Configuration data is copied between environment-specific data stores
- Access controls adjust automatically based on new environment

**Core Library Approach**:
- Promotions involve exporting configuration from Explore Application
- Importing and adapting configuration into Main Application
- Validating compatibility with production governance requirements

### Multi-Level Quota Management

*[In a professional document, this would be a hierarchical diagram showing how quotas cascade from platform to team to individual levels, with inheritance, overrides, and enforcement points. The diagram would use professional tree structure notation, aggregation indicators, and allocation visualization.]*

The platform will implement multi-level quota management:

1. **Platform Quotas**: Global limits on total resource consumption
2. **Team Quotas**: Allocations for specific teams or departments
3. **Individual Quotas**: Limits for individual users
4. **Use Case Quotas**: Constraints on specific use case resource consumption

### Resource Dashboard Concept

*[In a professional document, this would be a mockup of a resource dashboard with gauges, charts, and allocation visualizations showing current usage versus limits at different levels. The mockup would use professional UI conventions, data visualization best practices, and realistic metrics representation.]*
